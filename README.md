Welcome to the **Guess the Shark** game! This is a fun web-based game where players must identify various species of sharks based on images shown. I am currently 17 years old and have a keen interest in marine biology and web development. 
This game combines both of these passions, allowing users to learn about different sharks while testing their knowledge.
